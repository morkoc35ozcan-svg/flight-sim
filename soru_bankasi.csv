1,"Chapter 1","What are the forces acting on an aircraft in flight?","Drag, thrust, lift, and weight."
2,"Chapter 1","When thrust and drag are in equilibrium, an aircraft will maintain","a steady speed."
3,"Chapter 1","For an aircraft to accelerate, thrust must exceed the","value of drag."
4,"Chapter 1","When lift and weight are in equilibrium, an aircraft will","maintain a steady, level attitude."
5,"Chapter 1","For an aircraft to climb, lift must","exceed the weight of the aircraft."
6,"Chapter 1","In a banked turn, weight is a constant, but lift is lost due to the","effective reduction in wing span."
7,"Chapter 1","Therefore, to maintain altitude in a banked turn, the lift value needs to be restored by increasing speed and/or the angle of attack.","(Statement completing the previous concept)"
8,"Chapter 1","What produces the maximum glide range?","A maximum lift-drag ratio, obtained by the aircraft being flown at its optimal angle of attack and corresponding minimum drag speed (VIMD), produces an aircraft's maximum glide range."
9,"Chapter 1","What is the effect of weight on the glide range?","The glide range does not vary with weight, provided that the aircraft is flown at its optimal angle of attack and speed for that weight, because the glide range is proportional to the lift-drag ratio, which does not vary with weight."
10,"Chapter 1","Therefore, if a heavy aircraft were flown at the correct angle of attack and speed, it would glide the same distance as a lighter aircraft.","However, the heavier aircraft would have a higher airspeed than the lighter aircraft, and therefore, although it would glide the same distance, it would take less time to do so."
11,"Chapter 1","What is rate of climb/descent?","Rate of climb/descent is the vertical component of the velocity of an aircraft and determines the time it will take to either climb or descend from a given height. It is normally expressed in terms of feet per minute."
12,"Chapter 1","What is the effect of weight on rate of descent?","The heavier the aircraft, the greater its rate of descent. This is so because a heavy aircraft will fly at a higher airspeed for a given angle of attack, and so its rate of descent will be increased."
13,"Chapter 1","What is an aerofoil?","An aerofoil is a body that gives a large lift force compared with its drag when set at a small angle to a moving airstream, e.g., aircraft wings, tailplanes, rudders, and propellers."
14,"Chapter 1","What is an aerofoil chord line?","The chord line is a straight line from the leading edge to the trailing edge of an aerofoil."
15,"Chapter 1","What is the mean chord line?","The mean chord line is the wing area divided by the wing span (sometimes referred to as the standard mean chord)."
16,"Chapter 1","What is the mean chamberline?","The mean chamberline is a line from the leading edge to the trailing edge of equidistance on the upper and lower surfaces of an aerofoil."
17,"Chapter 1","What is the angle of incidence?","The angle of incidence is the angle between the aerofoil's chord line and the aircraft's longitudinal datum. It is a fixed angle for a wing but may be variable for a tailplane. (It is sometimes called rigging incidence.)"
18,"Chapter 1","What is angle of attack?","Angle of attack is the angle between the chord line of an aerofoil and the relative airflow."
19,"Chapter 1","What is washout on a wing?","Washout is a decrease in the angle of incidence from the wing root to the tip. This compensates for the early stall due to the higher levels of loading experienced at the wing tips."
20,"Chapter 1","What is dihedral?","Dihedral is the upward inclination of a wing from the root to the tip."
21,"Chapter 1","What is anhedral?","Anhedral is the downward inclination of a wing from the root to the tip."
22,"Chapter 1","What is lift?","Lift is the phenomenon generated by an aerofoil due to pressure differences above and below the aerofoil."
23,"Chapter 1","What if the formula for lift?","1/2 R V^2 S CL. 1/2 R = the value of the air density. V^2 = airflow velocity squared. S = wing span area. CL = coefficient of lift. The combined values of these properties determine the amount of lift produced."
24,"Chapter 1","What is coefficient of lift (CL)?","Coefficient of lift (CL) is the lifting ability of a particular wing. It depends on both the shape of the wing section (fixed design feature) and the angle of attack."
25,"Chapter 1","Describe center of pressure.","The center of pressure is represented as a single point acting on the wing chord line at a right angle to the relative airflow, through which the wing's lifting force is produced. The position of the center of pressure is not a fixed point but depends on the distribution of pressure along the chord, which itself depends on the angle of attack."
26,"Chapter 1","Describe the lift-weight pitching moments.","If the forces of lift and weight are not acting through the same point (line), then they will set up a moment causing either a nose-up or nose-down pitch depending on whether the lift is acting in front of or behind the center of gravity point."
27,"Chapter 1","Describe aspect ratio.","Aspect ratio is the ratio of the wing's span to its geometric chord, e.g., 4:1."
28,"Chapter 1","During what phase of flight is lift the greatest?","In general, the takeoff."
29,"Chapter 1","What is direct lift control?","The elevator/stabilizer provides the direct lift control. The elevator and stabilizer are aerofoils that by their positions create an upward or downward balancing force that controls the direct lift force from the main aerofoils (wings), thus determining the attitude of the aircraft around the lateral axis."
30,"Chapter 1","What are high lift devices?","The following devices increase the lift force produced by the wings: 1. Trailing edge flaps (Fowler flaps). 2. Leading edge flaps (Krueger flaps) and slats. 3. Slots (boundary layer control)."
31,"Chapter 1","What is drag?","Drag is the resistance to motion of an object (aircraft) through the air."
32,"Chapter 1","Define the two major types of drag and their speed relationship.","Profile and induced drag total drag. Profile drag is also known as zero-lift drag and is comprised of 1. Form or pressure drag 2. Skin-friction drag 3. Interference drag. Profile drag increases directly with speed. Induced drag is caused by creating lift with a high angle of attack... Thus induced drag is greatest at lower speeds."
33,"Chapter 1","Describe the drag curve for a piston/propeller aircraft.","For a piston-engined propeller aircraft read straight-winged. It has a typical total drag curve comprised of a well-defined steep profile drag curve at high speeds... It also has a well-defined induced drag curve at low speeds."
34,"Chapter 1","Describe the drag curve on a jet aircraft.","The drag curve on a jet aircraft is the same as for a piston aircraft in that it is comprised of induced drag, profile drag, and a VIMD speed, but its speed-to-drag relationship is different. This is so because the jet aircraft has swept wings..."
35,"Chapter 1","Describe the pitching moment associated with the thrust-drag couple.","If the forces of thrust and drag are not acting through the same point (line), then they will set up a moment causing either a nose-up or nose-down pitch depending on whether the thrust is acting above or below the dragline."
36,"Chapter 1","What are high-drag devices?","The following devices increase the drag penalty on an aircraft: 1. Trailing edge flaps (in high-drag/low-lift position). 2. Spoilers (a. In fight detent, used as a speed brake; b. On the ground, used as lift dumpers). 3. Landing gear. 4. Reverse thrust (ground use only). 5. Braking parachute."
37,"Chapter 1","What causes/are wing-tip vortices?","Wing-tip vortices are created by span-wise airflow over the upper and lower surfaces of a wing/aerofoil that meet at the wing tips as turbulence and therefore induces drag, especially on a swept wing."
38,"Chapter 1","What are the effects of span-wise airflow over a wing?","1. Creates wing-tip vortices. 2. Reduced aileron (wing control surface) efficiency. 3. Reversed span-wise airflow increases disturbed airflow on the wing's upper surface at the tip, contributing to a wing-tip stall."
39,"Chapter 1","What are the effects of wing-tip vortices?","1. Create aircraft drag (induced drag...). 2. Vortices create turbulence, which may affect the safety of other aircraft... 3. Downwash affects the direction of the relative airflow over the tailplane..."
40,"Chapter 1","How do you prevent span-wise airflow on a wing, especially a swept wing?","Fences and vortex generators. These items direct the airflow over the wing's upper surface perpendicular to the leading edge."
41,"Chapter 1","What is the purpose of vortex generators/fences?","To reduce span-wise airflow and thereby reduce its effects."
42,"Chapter 1","What are winglets, and how do they work?","Winglets are aerodynamically efficient surfaces located at the wing tips. They are designed to reduce induced drag. They dispense the span-wise airflow from the upper and lower surfaces at different points, thus preventing the intermixing of these airflows that otherwise would create induced-drag vortices."
43,"Chapter 1","What limits an aircraft's structural weight?","The main force generated to balance the aircraft's gross weight is the lift force, and if the lift cannot equal the aircraft's weight, then the aircraft cannot maintain level flight. Therefore, the aircraft weight is directly restricted by the lift capabilities of the aircraft."
44,"Chapter 1","What are the effects of excessive aircraft weight?","If the limiting weight of an aircraft is exceeded, the following effects are experienced: 1. Performance is reduced (Takeoff/landing distance increased, Rate of climb/ceiling reduced, Range/endurance reduced, Max speed reduced). 2. Stalling speed is increased. 3. Maneuverability is reduced. 4. Wear on tires and brakes is increased. 5. Structural safety margins are reduced."
45,"Chapter 1","Describe center of gravity.","The center of gravity (C of G, CG) is the point through which the total weight of a body will act."
46,"Chapter 1","Describe a component arm.","The definition of a component arm is the distance from the datum to the point at which the weight of a component acts (center of gravity point)."
47,"Chapter 1","Describe center of gravity moment.","The moment is the turning effect/force of a weight around the datum. It is the product of the weight multiplied by the arm: Moment = weight * arm."
48,"Chapter 1","How is the pitching moment of the lift-weight couple balanced?","When the pitching moment of the lift-weight couple is not balanced perfectly, extra forces are provided by the horizontal tailplane to center the aircraft's pitching moment."
49,"Chapter 1","Describe the center of gravity range.","The center of gravity range relates to the furthest forward and aft center of gravity positions along the aircraft's longitudinal axis, inside which the aircraft is permitted to fly. This is so because the horizontal tailplane can generate a sufficient lift force to balance the aircraft's lift-weight moment couple so that it remains longitudinally stable and retains a manageable pitch control."
50,"Chapter 1","What are the reasons/effects of keeping a center of gravity inside its limits?","The forward position is limited to ensure the aircraft is not too nose heavy... The aft position is limited to ensure the aircraft is not too tail heavy..."
51,"Chapter 1","What are the effects of a center of gravity outside its limits (range)?","If outside forward limit: Nose heavy, increased longitudinal stability, reduced pitch control, large balancing download required. If outside aft limit: Tail heavy, longitudinally unstable, increased pitch control (too responsive), large balancing upload required."
52,"Chapter 1","What factors determine the loading (weight and balance) of an aircraft?","(See Chapter 7, 'Performance,' subchapter, 'Loading.')"
53,"Chapter 1","If you were loading an aircraft to obtain maximum range, would you load it with a forward or aft center of gravity?","An aft center of gravity position/hold loading, for aircraft (especially jet/swept wing) with a nose-up en route attitude will allow it to achieve its maximum possible range."
54,"Chapter 1","How does a forward center of gravity affect the stall speed, and why?","A center of gravity forward of the center of pressure will cause a higher stall speed. This is so because a forward center of gravity would cause a natural nose-down attitude... Therefore, a downward force is induced by the stabilizer... this downward force is in effect a weight and thereby increases the aircraft's overall effective weight."
55,"Chapter 1","Why does a jet aircraft have a large center of gravity range?","A jet aircraft needs a large center of gravity range because its center of gravity position can change dramatically with a large change in its weight during a flight."
56,"Chapter 1","What causes center of gravity movement?","The center of gravity is the point through which weight acts. Therefore, movement of the center of gravity is due to a change in weight. Reasons: 1. Fuel burn. 2. Passenger movement. 3. High speeds."
57,"Chapter 1","How does minimum control speed in the air (VMCG/A) vary with center of gravity position?","(See Chapter 7, 'Performance and Flight Planning'.)"
58,"Chapter 1","Describe the effects of an aircraft's momentum.","Momentum of a body is the product of the mass of the body and its velocity, which enables the body (aircraft) to remain on its previous direction and magnitude for a quantity of time after an opposing force has been applied."
59,"Chapter 1","How does weight affect an aircraft's flight profile descent point?","The heavier the aircraft, the earlier is its required descent point. The heavier the aircraft, the greater is its momentum... Therefore, for a constant indicated air speed (IAS) or Mach number, the heavier aircraft will have to maintain a shallower rate of descent to check its momentum."
60,"Chapter 1","What is positive g force?","Positive g force is the influence of the force of gravity on the normal terrestrial environment beneath it. This is perceived as the normal weight of any body, including ourselves, in the terrestrial environment, i.e., 1g."
61,"Chapter 1","What is negative g force?","Negative g force is the opposite to positive g force (i.e., the influence of the normal terrestrial environment above the force of gravity, 1g)."
62,"Chapter 1","Describe how you would design a high-speed aircraft wing.","Thin, minimal-chamber, swept wings."
63,"Chapter 1","How does a swept wing aid the increase in its critical Mach number (Mcrit) speed?","The swept-wing design increases its Mcrit speed because it is sensitive to the (airflow) airspeed vector normal to the leading edge for a given aircraft Mach number. A swept wing makes the velocity vector normal (perpendicular) to the leading edge a shorter distance than the chordwise resultant."
64,"Chapter 1","Describe how you would optimize the lift design on a swept wing.","To optimize the lift design on a swept wing, you would need to (1) examine and develop the lift design areas of the clean wing and (2) add high lift devices to the clean wing to a degree that satisfies our main lift concern, that of adequate airfield performance."
65,"Chapter 1","What advantages does a jet aircraft gain from a swept wing?","The advantages a jet aircraft gains from the swept wing are (1) high Mach cruise speeds and (2) stability in turbulence."
66,"Chapter 1","What disadvantages does a jet aircraft suffer from a swept wing?","1. Poor lift qualities. 2. Higher stall speeds. 3. Speed instability. 4. A wing-tip stalling tendency."
67,"Chapter 1","Where does a swept wing stall first, and what effect does this have on the aircraft's attitude?","A simple swept and/or tapered wing will stall at the wing tip first if not induced/controlled to stall at another wing section first by the designer. A stall at the wing tip causes a loss of lift outboard and therefore aft, which moves the center of pressure inboard and therefore forward; this produces a pitch-up tendency."
68,"Chapter 1","Explain speed stability.","Speed stability is the behavior of the speed after a disturbance at a fixed power setting. Speed is said to be stable if after it has been disturbed from its trimmed state it returns naturally to its original speed."
69,"Chapter 1","What is Mach number?","Mach number (MN) is a true airspeed indication, given as a percentage relative to the local speed of sound; e.g., half the speed of sound = 0.5 Mach."
70,"Chapter 1","What is the critical Mach number (Mcrit)?","Mcrit is the aircraft's Mach speed at which the airflow over a wing becomes sonic-critical Mach number."
71,"Chapter 1","Describe the characteristics of critical Mach number (Mcrit)?","1. Initial Mach buffet. 2. An increase in drag. 3. A nose-down change in attitude (Mach tuck). 4. A possible loss of control."
72,"Chapter 1","Describe the changes in the center of pressure as an aircraft speed increases past the critical Mach number (Mcrit).","The center of pressure moves rearward on a swept wing as the aircraft passes its Mcrit for two reasons: 1. The shock waves on the wing's upper surface occur toward the leading edge... 2. The swept wing tends to experience the shock-wave effect at the thick root part of the wing first, causing a loss of lift inboard..."
73,"Chapter 1","What is Mach tuck?","Mach tuck is the nose-down pitching moment an aircraft experiences as it passes its critical Mach number (Mcrit)."
74,"Chapter 1","What is the purpose of a Mach trimmer?","The purpose of a Mach trimmer is to automatically compensate for Mach tuck (longitudinal instability) above Mcrit."
75,"Chapter 1","What is a Mach trimmer, and what is it used for?","A Mach trimmer is a system that artificially corrects for Mach tuck above the aircraft's Mcrit by sensing the aircraft's speed and signaling a proportional upward movement of the elevator or variable-incidence stabilizer to maintain the aircraft's pitch attitude."
76,"Chapter 1","What are the effects of compressibility?","Compressibility is the effect of air being compressed onto a surface (at a right angle to the relative airflow), resulting in an increase in density, and thus dynamic pressure rises above its expected value. Effects: 1. Compressibility error on dynamic pressure reading flight instruments. 2. Compressed air is experienced on the leading edge of the wing."
77,"Chapter 1","What is the main influence on Mach number?","(See Chapter 5, 'Atmosphere and Speed.')"
78,"Chapter 1","Explain speed margins.","A speed margin is the difference between the aircraft's normal maximum permitted operating speed and its higher certified testing speed."
79,"Chapter 1","Explain maneuverability margins/envelope.","Maneuverability margin/envelope is contained by its upper and lower speed limits."
80,"Chapter 1","What is coffin corner?","Coffin corner occurs at an aircraft's absolute ceiling, where the speeds at which Mach number buffet and prestall buffet occur are coincident, and although trained for, in practice, they are difficult to distinguish between."
81,"Chapter 1","Explain why an aircraft stalls.","An aircraft stalls when the streamlined/laminar airflow (or boundary layer) over the wing's upper surface... breaks away from the surface when the critical angle of attack is exceeded, irrespective of airspeed, and becomes turbulent, causing a loss in lift."
82,"Chapter 1","What properties affect an aircraft's stall speed?","1. Weight. 2. Altitude. 3. Wing design/lift. 4. Configuration. 5. Propeller engine power."
83,"Chapter 1","How does the stall speed vary with weight?","The heavier the aircraft, the higher is the indicated speed at which the aircraft will stall. The stall speed is proportional to the square root of the aircraft's weight."
84,"Chapter 1","What wing design areas delay the breakup of airflow (stall)?","1. Wing slots are the main design feature that delays/suppresses stall speed. 2. Lower angle of incidence and a greater chamber for a particular wing section, e.g., wing tips."
85,"Chapter 1","What changes the aircraft's angle of attack at the stall?","The movement of the center of pressure point at the stall causes a change in the aircraft's angle of attack."
86,"Chapter 1","What happens to the stall speeds at very high altitudes, and why?","The stall speed increases at very high altitudes... because of 1. Mach number compressibility effect on the wing. 2. Compressibility error on the IAS/ASI(R)."
87,"Chapter 1","How does stall speed vary with center of gravity position?","(See Q: How does a forward center of gravity affect the stall speed, and why?)"
88,"Chapter 1","What is a superstall?","A superstall also may be referred to as a deep stall or a Locked in stall condition, which, as the name suggests, is a stall from which the aircraft is unable to recover."
89,"Chapter 1","What systems protect against a stall?","Stall warner's and stick pushers."
90,"Chapter 1","What is Dutch roll?","Dutch roll is an oscillatory instability associated with swept-wing jet aircraft. It is the combination of yawing and rolling motions."
91,"Chapter 1","What causes Dutch roll?","Swept wings. Dutch roll occurs when a yaw is induced... This causes the outer wing to travel faster... At the same time, the inner wing will travel slower..."
92,"Chapter 1","What is the recovery technique from Dutch roll?","For a pilot to recover an aircraft suffering from Dutch roll, he or she would apply opposite aileron to the direction of the roll, assuming that the yaw dampers are not serviceable."
93,"Chapter 1","What prevents Dutch roil?","Yaw dampers prevent Dutch roll on swept-wing aircraft."
94,"Chapter 1","What is directional stability?","Directional stability is the tendency for an aircraft to regain its direction (heading) after the aircraft has been directionally disturbed (e.g., an induced yaw) from its straight path."
95,"Chapter 1","What is spiral stability and instability?","Spiral stability (or a spirally stable aircraft) is defined as the tendency of an aircraft in a properly coordinated banked turn to return to a laterally level flight attitude on release of the ailerons. Spiral instability... will see a banked turn increase fairly quickly, followed by the nose falling into the turn..."
96,"Chapter 1","What is lateral stability?","Lateral stability is the tendency for an aircraft to return to a laterally level position around the longitudinal axis on release of the ailerons in a sideslip."
97,"Chapter 1","What is longitudinal stability?","Longitudinal stability is an aircraft's natural ability to return to a stable pitch position around its lateral axis after a disturbance."
98,"Chapter 1","Describe stability at high altitudes.","Longitudinal, lateral, directional, and oscillatory stability in general are reduced at high altitudes, in terms of dynamic stability, mainly because aerodynamic damping decreases with altitude."
99,"Chapter 1","What are the four flying-quality penalties experienced at very high altitudes?","1. Restricted operating speed range. 2. Reduced maneuverability. 3. Reduced aerodynamic damping. 4. Reduced stability."
100,"Chapter 1","What are the primary/main flight controls?","Elevator (Pitch). Ailerons (Roll). Rudder (Yaw)."
101,"Chapter 1","What is the elevator, and how does it work?","The conventional elevator is a hinged control surface at the rear of the horizontal tailplane (stabilizer) that is controlled by the pilot's control column. Moving the control column back deflects the elevator up... producing a downward aerodynamic force that pitches the aircraft up."
102,"Chapter 1","What are ailerons, and how do they work?","Ailerons are control surfaces located at the trailing edges of the wings that control the aircraft's motion around its longitudinal axis, known as roll."
103,"Chapter 1","What is the rudder and how does it work?","The rudder is a hinged control surface at the rear of the fin (vertical tailplane) that is controlled by the pilot's rudder pedals."
104,"Chapter 1","How does the effectiveness of the control surfaces vary with speed?","The control surfaces become more effective at higher speeds. This results in a requirement for large control movements at low speeds and smaller control movements at high speeds to produce the same control force."
105,"Chapter 1","What is elevator reversal?","Elevator reversal occurs at high speeds when the air loads/forces are large enough to cause a twisting moment on the deflected elevator surface to either a neutral or opposite position that results in sudden reversal of the aircraft's pitch attitude."
106,"Chapter 1","What is adverse yaw?","Adverse yaw is a yawing motion opposite to the turning/rolling motion of the aircraft. Adverse yaw is caused by the drag on the down-going aileron being greater than that on the up-going aileron."
107,"Chapter 1","What is aileron reversal (adverse), and when is it likely to occur?","Aileron reversal occurs at high speeds when the air loads/forces are large enough that they cause an increase in lift... a nose-down twisting moment will be caused. This will result in a decrease in the incidence of the wing... hence an adverse rolling motion."
108,"Chapter 1","What is a yaw-induced adverse rolling motion, and when is it likely to occur?","The rudder inducing the aircraft to yaw one way can cause another form of adverse rolling motion in the opposite direction. This happens at high speeds..."
109,"Chapter 1","What are spoilers, and how do they work?","Spoilers consist of opening panels that extend from the upper surface of the wing and have the effect of spoiling/disturbing the airflow over the wing (drag), thereby reducing the lift."
110,"Chapter 1","What are the three purposes of spoilers?","1. Roll control (usually in combination with the ailerons). 2. Air speed brakes. 3. Ground lift dumpers."
111,"Chapter 1","Describe differential and nondifferential spoilers.","Nondifferential spoilers: When already partly extended as a speed brake, the spoilers will extend further on one side but will not retract on the other side... Differential spoilers: When already partly extended as a speed brake, the spoilers will extend further on one side and retract on the other side in response to a roll command."
112,"Chapter 1","Give six reasons for spoilers.","1. Ailerons are limited in size. 2. Aileron reversal prevention. 3. Ailerons lose effectiveness at high speeds. 4. Adverse rolling moment with yaw. 5. Air speed brakes. 6. Ground lift dumpers."
113,"Chapter 1","What limits the use of spoilers, and why do spoilers blow back?","Spoilers are limited by very high speeds (VDF/MDF), which cause them to blow back. This occurs because the high air loads experienced on the spoilers' surfaces at high speeds are greater than their design limit."
114,"Chapter 1","How is spoiler blowback prevented?","Spoilers are designed not to blow back in the normal operating speed range of the aircraft."
115,"Chapter 1","How do you correct for spoiler biowback?","In flight, reduce speed by reducing thrust to a speed where the spoilers will operate normally, and then recycle the speed brake lever."
116,"Chapter 1","What do leading-edge slats do?","Leading-edge slats increase the wing's chamber area and mean aerodynamic chord (MAC), thereby increasing its coefficient of lift (CL) maximum, which reduces the aircraft's stall speed."
117,"Chapter 1","What are Krueger flaps?","Krueger flaps are leading-edge wing flaps used to increase the wing chamber and therefore increase the coefficient of lift maximum."
118,"Chapter 1","What are Fowler flaps?","Fowler flaps are trailing-edge wing flaps (usually triple slotted) used to increase the wing area and chamber, which increases the coefficient of lift maximum for low flap settings."
119,"Chapter 1","What is the primary use of flaps on a jet aircraft?","The primary use of flaps, especially on a jet aircraft, is to increase lift by extending the geometric chord line of the wing, which increase its chamber and area."
120,"Chapter 1","What are the effects of extending flaps in flight?","Lowering the flaps in flight generally will cause a change in the pitching moment. Normally, the increased lift created by extending the wing chord line when the flaps are extended is dominant and will cause a nose-up pitching tendency."
121,"Chapter 1","What are the effects of raising flaps in flight?","The raising of flaps in flight, if not compensated for by increasing speed and changing attitude, will result in a loss of lift."
122,"Chapter 1","How do flaps affect takeoff ground run?","Flaps set within the takeoff range: A higher flap setting... will reduce the takeoff ground run for a given aircraft weight. Flaps set outside the takeoff range: A high flap setting... will result in a large drag penalty that will reduce the aircraft's acceleration, and therefore, the takeoff run will be greatly increased."
123,"Chapter 1","What are the purposes of yaw and roll dampers, and how do they work?","The purpose of a yaw damper is to: (1) prevent Dutch roll and (2) coordinate turns. The purpose of a roll dampers is to: (1) damp/remove Dutch roll, (2) provide roll damping in turbulence, and (3) provide spiral stability."
124,"Chapter 1","Describe parallel yaw dampers.","Parallel yaw dampers (early type) apply rudder control through the same control run as the pilot, and their activity is reflected in the rudder bar activity (moves the rudder pedals)."
125,"Chapter 1","Describe series yaw dampers.","The series yaw damper... is attached to the rudder control circuit at the back of the aircraft, and as such, it does not move the pilot's rudder pedals when it moves the rudder."
126,"Chapter 1","What is a stabilizer/variable-incidence tailplane?","A stabilizer/variable-incidence tailplane is an all-moving horizontal tailplane control surface (i.e., not fixed in one position)."
127,"Chapter 1","What is the purpose of a stabilizer?","The purpose of the horizontal stabilizer is to provide a longitudinal balancing force to the aircraft."
128,"Chapter 1","What are the four reasons for a variable-incidence tailplane/stabilizer, especially on a jet aircraft?","1. To provide a balancing force for a large center of gravity range. 2. To provide a balancing force for a large speed range. 3. To cope (longitudinally) with large trim changes... 4. To reduce elevator trim drag to a minimum."
129,"Chapter 1","Describe the effects of a stuck stabilizer.","The condition an aircraft experiences from a stuck stabilizer... is a degraded longitudinal balancing ability... This condition has the following effects: 1. Heavy stick forces... 2. Slower response... 3. Pitch-control capability is reduced."
130,"Chapter 1","What is the best center of gravity position with a stuck stabilizer, and why?.","With a stuck stabilizer, the best center of gravity position is aft."
131,"Chapter 1","What is the required action with a stuck stabilizer?","1. Divert to a nearby airfield. 2. Move the center of gravity to an aft position. 3. Reduce speed as late as possible. 4. Plan a long final approach... 5. Use a reduced flap setting for landing."
132,"Chapter 1","Describe a runaway stabilizer condition and required action.","If brakes fail, the stabilizer will experience backpressure... which will rotate the stabilizer to its maximum upward or downward mechanical stops. Action: 1. Hold the control column firmly. 2. Autopilot disengage. 3. Stab trim cutout switches to cut out. 4. Stabilizer trim wheel, grasp and hold."
133,"Chapter 1","Describe the effects of a jammed/degraded elevator.","A degraded or jammed elevator will result in less effective elevator maneuverability in pitch control."
134,"Chapter 1","What is the best center of gravity position with a jammed/degraded elevator?","The best position for the center of gravity with a degraded/jammed elevator is aft."
135,"Chapter 1","What is the required action for a jammed/degraded elevator?","If there is no elevator control (jammed), then the stabilizer trim can be used for pitch control. 1. If possible, move the center of gravity rearward. 2. Plan a long final approach... 3. Restrict the flap angle for landing."
136,"Chapter 1","Describe the effects of a failure/reduction in elevator feels.","Whenever the feel on an elevator control is significantly reduced, great care must be exercised in its use. The control must be moved slowly and smoothly over minimum angles to avoid overstressing the control surface structure."
137,"Chapter 1","What is the best center of gravity position with a reduced or failed elevator feel system?","The best position for the center of gravity with a reduced or failed elevator feel system is forward."
138,"Chapter 1","Describe the effects of the air loads on a control surface and how these effects are managed?","If a control surface is deflected, the dynamic pressure/aerodynamic loads on it will increase and act as a lift force through its center of pressure point.

283,"Chapter 4","What has the furthest range, a VOR or an NDB?","A nondirectional beacon (NDB) in theory has the farthest range because of its surface-wave propagation path... compared with the VOR's line-of-sight propagation path."
284,"Chapter 4","Describe an instrument landing system (ILS) and how it works.","The instrument landing system (ILS) is a precision approach radio aid... An ILS has two separate ground transmitters: 1. The localizer (azimuth)... 2. The glide slope (elevation)."
285,"Chapter 4","What is an ILS backcourse approach?","Some ILS installations provide a mirror image of the localizer beam on the reciprocal runway known as a backcourse beam. Like any mirror image, right is left and left is right..."

303,"Chapter 3","Describe the approach differences between a jet and a piston engine propeller aircraft.","There are six main handling differences between a jet aircraft and a propeller aircraft on the landing approach[cite: 3371]. The six main differences involve aerodynamics and the engines[cite: 3373]. 1. Momentum: The jet aircraft has a greater momentum than the lighter and slower propeller-driven aircraft[cite: 3374]. 2. Speed stability: The jet aircraft suffers from poor speed stability being an inducement to a low-speed condition[cite: 3376]. 3. Wing lift values: The jet aircraft's swept wing produces less lift than the propeller aircraft's straight wing[cite: 3377]. 4. Engine response rate/acceleration and deceleration: The jet engine has a poorer acceleration response at low-rpm speeds known as lag[cite: 3380]. 5. Slipstream effects: The propeller slipstream produces an immediate extra lift value over the wings at a constant airspeed but is absent on jet aircraft[cite: 3386]. 6. Power-on stall speed: The stall speed is significantly lower when the engine power is increased or on for a propeller aircraft... For a jet aircraft, which does not produce a slipstream over the wing, the stall speed is virtually unchanged with its power on[cite: 3387, 3388]."
304,"Chapter 3","Explain the (low) speed control difference between a jet aircraft and a propelier-driven aircraft.","The speed control for both jet and propeller-driven aircraft is a function of drag against speed[cite: 3390]. The jet aircraft's relatively flat drag curve over the low speed range makes it difficult to select the correct thrust for the required speed because of the minimal difference in thrust required values across a large speed range[cite: 3394]. Therefore, it is easy to select an incorrect speed control thrust setting, and any slight difference, whether higher or lower, will set up a speed divergence that is also difficult to detect[cite: 3395]. In contrast, the propeller-driven aircraft's drag curve is markedly different across its low-speed range, and therefore, it is much easier to determine and set the correct power to balance the drag and to deliver the desired speed[cite: 3398]."
305,"Chapter 3","What speed stability differences are there between a jet aircraft and a propeller-driven aircraft?","The jet aircraft's speed stability is much poorer than that of a propeller-driven aircraft because of the following two main differences [cite: 3403]: 1. The jet's recommended threshold speed (i.e., 1.4 Vs) tends to be in the neutral or unstable speed range[cite: 3404]. 2. Thrust changes with speed, which helps to improve the speed stability on propeller-driven aircraft and does not improve it on jet aircraft[cite: 3405]."
306,"Chapter 3","Describe the difference between a jet and a piston-engined propeller aircraft's stali speed.","The stall speed of a piston-engined propeller aircraft generally is a slower speed than that of a jet aircraft[cite: 3408]. Also, the range of the stall speeds is much larger for a jet aircraft than for a piston-engined propeller aircraft[cite: 3409]."
307,"Chapter 3","Describe the differences between propeller and jet aircraft wing performance.","The performance margin of a propeller-driven aircraft's straight wing is greater than that of a jet aircraft's swept wing, especially when contaminated[cite: 3411]. The reason for the improved relative performance on a propeller-driven aircraft is that the wing is unswept and there is a high-energy airflow (prop wash) over the upper surface of the wing that partly offsets some of the contaminant effects[cite: 3412]. On a jet, the available performance margin with a contaminated wing is practically zero for two main reasons[cite: 3413]. First, there is no upper-surface high-energy flow available. Second, the wing sweep decreases the amount of lift generated for a given angle of attack relative to the straight wing...[cite: 3414]."
308,"Chapter 5","What is the aviation definition of height?","Height is the measured distance above the ground (i.e., QFE)."

313,"Chapter 5","What is air pressure?","Air pressure is the weight of a column of air or the gravity force of air molecules. Air pressure is influenced by gravity and is proportional to density. Therefore, air pressure decreases with a rise in altitude."
314,"Chapter 5","How many feet are in a millibar (hectopascal)?","The number of feet in a millibar or hectopascal is variable because the rate that the pressure changes with height is variable... The formula used to find the size of 1 millibar is 96 * absolute temperature / altitude pressure (millibars)."
315,"Chapter 5","How many inches of mercury to a millibar?","0.0295 inch of mercury equals 1 hectopascal/millibar."
316,"Chapter 5","What is pressure altitude?","Pressure altitude or pressure height is the international standard atmosphere (ISA) height above the 29.92-in/1013 millibar pressure datum, at which the pressure value experienced represents that of the level under consideration."
317,"Chapter 5","How do you calculate the pressure altitude's actual height?","To calculate a pressure altitude's actual height, you have to calculate the difference between the regional QNH and the 29.92-in/1013-millibar pressure datum. Then convert this pressure difference into a height, which you then add or subtract from the pressure altitude..."

321,"Chapter 5","If you were at 33,000 ft with an outside air temperature (OAT) of -45°C, what is the temperature deviation from international standard atmosphere (IAS)?","ISA temperature at 33,000 ft is -51°C. Actual temperature minus ISA temperature is -45°C - (-51°C) = +6°C. Therefore, temperature deviation at 33,000 ft is ISA +6°C."
322,"Chapter 5","What is density?","Density is defined as mass per unit volume of a substance."
323,"Chapter 5","What is density altitude?","Density altitude is the altitude above the 1013-millibar/29.92-in datum, at which the air density value experienced represents that of the level under consideration."
324,"Chapter 5","What are the main influences on air density?","1. Temperature 2. Pressure 3. Humidity. Temperature is the main influence on air density for a given pressure altitude."
325,"Chapter 5","How does the variation of air density due to temperature affect an aircraft's performance?","A warmer than international standard atmosphere (ISA) temperature for a given altitude causes a decrease in air density, which causes a decrease in the performance level of the aircraft's engines and a decrease in aerodynamic performance..."
326,"Chapter 5","What density errors are commonly experienced?","Altitude error and air-speed error. Density for a particular pressure altitude is affected by temperature such that an altitude error will exist when the actual temperature experienced is different from the ISA temperature."
327,"Chapter 5","What is static pressure?","Static pressure is the equal weight of all the air molecules at any one point in the atmosphere. Static pressure... does not involve any motion of the body relative to the air..."
328,"Chapter 5","What is dynamic pressure?","Dynamic pressure is the pressure (over and above the static pressure) of the air molecules impacting onto a surface caused by either the movement of a body (e.g., an aircraft) through the air or the air flowing over a stationary object."
329,"Chapter 5","Describe IAS.","Indicated airspeed (IAS) is a measure of dynamic pressure translated to a speed and displayed to the pilot on the airspeed indicator (ASI) usually as knots per hour."

332,"Chapter 5","Describe TAS.","True airspeed (TAS) is simply the actual speed of an aircraft through the air mass in which it is flying. TAS therefore depends on the air density properties of the air mass in which the aircraft is flying."
333,"Chapter 5","Describe ground speed.","Ground speed is the actual speed of an aircraft relative to the ground. Ground speed is a combination of 1. True airspeed... 2. Wind velocity..."
334,"Chapter 5","Describe LSS.","LSS is the local speed of sound. The speed of sound, Mach 1.0, does not remain a constant value of knots per hour because it is influenced by temperature..."
335,"Chapter 5","How does temperature affect the LSS?","As temperature decreases, the local speed of sound (LSS) decreases."
336,"Chapter 5","Describe Mach number.","Mach number is the true airspeed (TAS) of an aircraft, given as a percentage relative to the local speed of sound (LSS) and displayed to the pilot on the Mach meter instrument."
337,"Chapter 5","How do you calculate Mach number?","Mach number (MN) is a calculation of the true airspeed (TAS) relative to the local speed of sound (LSS): MN = TAS / LSS."
338,"Chapter 5","What is the main influence on Mach number?","Temperature. As temperature decreases, the local speed of sound (LSS) decreases. If the LSS decreases for a constant true air speed (TAS), then the Mach number must rise."
339,"Chapter 5","What happens to the indicated Mach number (MN) in a long-range cruise as weight decreases at the same flight level (FL)?","It decreases."
340,"Chapter 5","What happens to your calculated airspeed (CAS) or indicated airspeed (IAS) if you descend at a constant true airspeed (TAS)?","The CAS (IAS) will increase. This is so because pressure increases with a decrease in altitude due to the gravity effect... Therefore, density increases... which means the CAS (IAS) increases in a descent at a constant TAS."
341,"Chapter 5","What happens to your true airspeed (TAS) if you climb at a constant calibrated airspeed (CAS) or indicated airspeed (IAS)?","The TAS will increase. This is so because air density decreases with altitude..."
342,"Chapter 5","What happens to your Mach number (MN) if you climb at a constant calibrated airspeed (CAS) or indicated airspeed (IAS)?","The MN will increase. This is so because true airspeed (TAS) increases because air density decreases with altitude and the local speed of sound (LSS) decreases because of a reduction in air temperature..."
343,"Chapter 5","What happens to your calibrated airspeed (CAS) or indicated airspeed (IAS) and true airspeed (TAS) if you fly at a constant CAS (IAS) into a warmer area?","The CAS (IAS) remains constant because CAS (IAS) is unaffected by temperature, whereas the TAS will increase because of the decrease in air density associated with warmer temperatures."

347,"Chapter 5","What happens to the calibrated airspeed (CAS) or indicated airspeed (IAS) and Mach number (MN) if an aircraft climbs at a constant true airspeed (TAS) through an inversion layer?","CAS (IAS) decreases more than normal, and MN decreases."
348,"Chapter 6","What are the pressure flight instruments, and how do they work?","The pressure flight instruments are 1. Airspeed indicator (ASI)/Mach meter (MM) 2. Altimeter 3. Vertical speed indicator (VSI). Pressure instruments measure atmospheric pressure by using the pitot-static system[cite: 7894, 7895, 7896, 7897, 7898, 7899]."
349,"Chapter 6","How does the airspeed indicator (ASI) work?","The ASI measures dynamic pressure as the difference between the total pitot pressure measured in the instrument's capsule/diaphragm and the static pressure measured in the case. The dynamic pressure represents the indicated airspeed (IAS) as knots per hour[cite: 7908, 7909, 7910]."

QFE: This zeros the altimeter on the airfield elevation datum... QFF: This is similar to QNH except that it uses the actual conditions (not ISA) to find the sea level pressure... QNE: This is not an altimeter setting but is the height shown at touchdown on the altimeter with 29.92 in or 1013 millibars set... Standard setting: 29.92 in or 1013 hPa... will give altimeter readings as a pressure altitude or flight level...[cite: 7980, 7981, 7987, 7990, 7992, 7994]."

359,"Chapter 6","Given a temperature deviation from ISA of 36°C the pressure altimeter will (a) overread, (b) underread, or (c) read correctly, and why?","The altimeter will overread because the temperature deviation is colder than the international standard atmosphere (ISA); i.e., the altimeter reads an altitude higher than the actual altitude of the aircraft[cite: 8015, 8016, 8017]."
360,"Chapter 6","What do you know about servo-assisted altimeters?","A servo-assisted altimeter increases the accuracy of a simple pressure altimeter because its design no longer relies on a direct mechanical link between its capsule and the altitude pointer on the instruments display dial[cite: 8019, 8020]."

367,"Chapter 6","What are the disadvantages of an instantaneous vertical speed indicator (IVSI)?","The disadvantage of an IVSI is that the dashpots... are also affected by the acceleration in a turn. Therefore, the IVSI has an error that it initially shows as a rate of climb (ROC) when applying large angles of bank...[cite: 8046, 8047, 8048]."

378,"Chapter 6","What is apparent wander of a gyroscope?","Apparent wander is a natural phenomenon. A directional indicator (DI) gyro appears to wander not because of any real changes in the direction of the gyroscope's spin axis alignment in space but because its orientation has changed due to rotation of the earth[cite: 8113, 8114]."
379,"Chapter 6","How do you correct for apparent wander?","Depending on the sophistication of the instrument, apparent wander is corrected in one of two main ways: 1.

934,"Chapter 10","What should your sleep pattern be before a flight?","A pilot should manage his or her sleep pattern so that he or she awakes from a sleep a few hours before he or she is to report for duty so that he or she arrives for the flight fresh and awake."
935,"Chapter 10","What causes fatigue?","Fatigue is caused by (1) the lack of sleep and (2) overwork/stress."
936,"Chapter 10","What are the consequences of fatigue?","Fatigue causes 1. An increase in a pilot's response time 2. Impaired judgment 3. An increase in the possibility of human error."
937,"Chapter 10","What is hypoxia?","Hypoxia is a human condition that occurs when the oxygen supply available to the human tissues is insufficient to meet their needs, especially respiratory requirements."
938,"Chapter 10","What causes hypoxia?","Hypoxia is caused by altitude. The greater the altitude, the greater is the hypoxia, and the more rapid is its progression. This is so because respiration brings less oxygen into the body at high altitudes..."
939,"Chapter 10","How long do you have before you become unconscious from hypoxia at height?","18,000 ft: 30 minutes. 25,000 ft: 2-3 minutes. 30,000 ft: 45-74 seconds. 40,000 ft: 20 seconds. 45,000 ft: 12 seconds."
940,"Chapter 10","What are the indications/symptoms of hypoxia?","1. Cyanosis 2. Apparent personality change 3. Impaired judgment 4. Muscular impairment 5. Memory impairment 6. Sensory loss 7. Hyperventilation 8. Impairment of consciousness."
941,"Chapter 10","How do you treat hypoxia?","Increasing the individual's oxygen supply should treat hypoxia. Therefore, pilots should be familiar with the appropriate oxygen drills... above 10,000 ft."
942,"Chapter 10","What is hyperventilation?","Hyperventilation is the condition of overbreathing, i.e., in excess of the ventilation level required to remove carbon dioxide, causing changes in the acid-base balance of the body."
943,"Chapter 10","What causes hyperventilation?","1. Hypoxia 2. Anxiety 3. Motion sickness 4. Vibration 5. Heat 6. High g force."
944,"Chapter 10","What are the indications/symptoms of hyperventilation?","1. Dizziness 2. Tingling sensation 3. Visual disturbances 4. Hot or cold feelings 5. Anxiety 6. Impaired performance 7. Loss of consciousness."
945,"Chapter 10","How do you treat hyperventilation?","Below 10,000 ft: Regulate rate and depth of respiration (e.g., breathe into a paper bag). Above 10,000 ft: Treat as hypoxia (give oxygen)."
946,"Chapter 10","What is the most important exhaust gas that pilots should be aware of in terms of personal safety, and why?","Carbon monoxide (CO). It may enter the cabin if there are any leaks... This gas can cause headaches, breathlessness, impaired judgment, and eventually loss of consciousness."
947,"Chapter 10","What is carbon monoxide poisoning?","Carbon monoxide (CO) is a highly toxic colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas for which hemoglobin in the blood has an enormous affinity... starving the brain and body of oxygen."
948,"Chapter 10","How is carbon monoxide produced?","Carbon monoxide is produced during the combustion of fuel in the engine."
949,"Chapter 10","What are the indications that carbon monoxide is present?","1. Cherry red skin pigmentation from prolonged exposure. 2. Specific carbon monoxide indicators/systems (color changing cards or aural alarms)."
950,"Chapter 10","What are the symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning?","1. Headache 2. A slower breathing rate or breathlessness 3. Dizziness 4. Nausea 5. Deterioration in vision 6. Impaired judgment 7. Eventually loss of consciousness."
951,"Chapter 10","What actions should you take if you suspect carbon monoxide poisoning?","1. Shut off cabin heat 2. Stop all smoking 3. Increase the supply of fresh air 4. Don oxygen masks if available."
952,"Chapter 10","What is a visual whitening effect?","Whitening is a visual illusion whereby the perception of the distance to an object's surface is incorrect. That is, a close object is perceived to be far away."
953,"Chapter 10","What is visual empty field myopia?","Empty field myopia occurs when you are flying in clouds or pitch darkness... that make your eyes automatically focus to approximately 1 m of distance ahead."
954,"Chapter 10","What is visual blackhole effect?","Blackhole effect occurs when a runway in virtual pitch darkness... gives the visual illusion of the aircraft being at a greater height than its actual height."
955,"Chapter 10","What is the nighttime visual (eye acuity) effect?","...the runway always appears to be further away in terms of vertical distance than it actually is; therefore, you tend to land earlier than expected."
956,"Chapter 10","How long can you not fly after diving, and why?","Not allowed to fly for 12 hours after swimming/diving with compressed air. Not allowed to fly for 24 hours after diving to a depth of 30 ft or more. Reason: To protect against decompression sickness."
957,"Chapter 10","What is risky shift?","Risky shift is the tendency for a group of people to decide on a riskier, even more dangerous decision than an individual who is part of the group would make by himself or herself."
958,"Chapter 10","Are you more likely to take a risk as an individual or as a group?","Groups of people are more likely to decide to take a greater risk than an individual would... because in a group we take confidence in other people and their decisions."
959,"Chapter 10","How long should you wait before flying after consuming alcohol?","Eight hours (after consuming a small quantity of alcohol) and ensuring that all the alcohol has left your system."
960,"Chapter 11","Describe your aircraft's wing.","As a guideline, you should cover the following areas: 1. Type: i.e., straight, tapered, swept, or delta 2. Dimension: Span, Mean aerodynamic chord (MAC), Turning radius 3. Airflow control, i.e., design features: Winglets, Fences, Vortex generators, Slots, etc. 4. Speeds: Indicated Mach number at which the airflow over the wing is Mach 1... Airspeed to be flown if the Mach trimmers fails 5. Design features: Trailing-edge flaps, Leading-edge flaps."
